# 👋 Hi, I'm Ian

I'm an interdisciplinary student with a focus on data science, AI/ML, and creative tooling. I enjoy bridging the gap between technical rigor and creative experimentation — whether through code, systems design, or engineering. I am especially interested in **ML**, **data analysis**, **audio analysis**, and **mathematical computing**.

## 🔧 What I Do

- 🧠 **Data & AI** — Python, Rust, and statistical computing for ML pipelines, research workflows, and intelligent tooling.
- 🛠️ **Creative Systems** — Custom knowledge workflows (Obsidian), terminal UX, and smart automation.

## 🧰 Tools I Work With

- Languages: `Python`, `R`, currently learning `MATLAB` and `Rust`
- OS: `EndeavourOS`, `Windows`
- Software: Obsidian, VS Code, RStudio, Sonic Visualizer, Hyper-V

## 📌 Featured Projects

- **Second Brain Toolkit** — Building a modular Wiki-like Zettelkasten system with smart tagging and CLI tools.
- **AI Audio Sketches (planned)** — Experimental DSP tools for experimental music-oriented audio analysis and generative audio using ML pipelines.
- **Pi Smart Lab (planned)** — Building a local LLM with access to helpful tools for data collection, automation, and creative coding.
